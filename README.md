Welcome to Scenic
===

Scenic is a scene graph implementation for Android, similar to [Java 3D](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_3D) for J2SE and the [Mobile 3D Graphics API](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_3D_Graphics_API) for J2ME.

Current status is that basic stuff works, but a lot of improvement is needed. It is currently good enough to build 2D games with 3D animation, but more features will appear shortly.

Please contribute improvements and fixes, or suggest them in our issue tracker.
